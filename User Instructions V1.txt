Internet connection.


[][][][] First-Time Instructions [][][][]

1.
Download Bukkit Server, for example from
https://serverjar.org/download-version/bukkit.

The software of this project was tested on Bukkit server versions for Minecraft 1.21.5 to 1.21.8, and they are currently confirmed to work. Others are untested but expected to work.

2.
Move the "server.jar" file that was just downloaded into the file location of your choosing, and execute the file. It will then unpack necessary files, which might take several minutes. Unpacking is finished when four new folders and two new text files appear in the same folder as server.jar.

3.
Open "eula.txt" and replace the value of "eula" to "true". Save and close the file.

4.
Open "server.properties" file and replace the value of "enable-command-block" with "true". This is the only obligatory action, but it is recommended to edit other values too, like setting "spawn-monsters" to "false" and "gamemode" to "creative". Save and close the file.

5.
Create a temporary text file in the same folder, any name. Open it. Into it, write

java -jar server.jar
PAUSE

Then, go to File -> Save as, change the "Save as type" to All files, and name the file "run.bat" without the quotation marks. You may delete the temporary text file if you want, it serves no further use.


6.
Launch the server by running "run.bat".

7.
Once the server has finished the start-up process, type into the server's console "op <Insert Your Minecraft User Name Here>" without the quotation marks. This grants the user operator rights in the server. Close the server by typing in the server's console "stop" without quotation marks.

8.
Download "Lookup Table.txt", "TM_GUI-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar" and "Turing_machine-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar" files from 
and move them into the folder named "plugins".

9.
Launch both the Minecraft client in the same version as the server, and the server again by running "run.bat".

10.
In the Minecraft client, go to Multiplayer -> Direct Connection, and enter the IPv4 address of the host. If you don't know the IPv4 address, here's how to find it: In the host machine or other computers connected to the same network, type into Windows' Command Prompt "ipconfig" without quotation marks, and look for the IPv4 address.

11.
In the first use, type "/initialize" without quotation marks into the Minecraft console. This will clear the operation area in the game, as well as teleport the player into the center of it. This will take a few minutes. If the server crashes, just restart the server and enter the command again.


[][][][] Usage instructions [][][][]

[][] GUI [][]

1.
Launch the GUI by executing "TM_GUI-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar".

2.
Enter the name of the Turing machine, the alphabet you want to be used, and the number of states, and then press the "Update instructions" button. Notice that due to how this code works, ',' is obviously not a valid alphabet character.

3.
Enter the values for each multiple choice element in each cell

4.
Once all values have been entered, the "generate the text file" button will be enabled. Pressing it will generate a text file containing the machine instructions into the plugins-folder.

5.
Either create other Turing machines, or close the program.


[][] Alternative - editing the text files [][]

1.
Go to the plugins-folder, and either create a new text file or open one of the text files other than "Lookup Table.txt".

2.
Each instruction is a comma-separated series of values, with the following format:
- First is an integer, representing the current state.
- Second is the tape symbol that is read from the current cell.
- Third is an integer, representing the next state.
- Fourth is the tape symbol that is to be written in the current cell.
- Fifth is the direction the tape is moved, with 0 representing moving it right or 1 moving it left.

Each row is treated as a separate instruction (what is done for each combination of state and input symbol).

It is important the format is followed exactly, otherwise the Minecraft plugin isn't capable of generating a valid Turing machine.

Once finished, save the file and close it.


[][] Lookup Table [][]
For the Minecraft plugin to be able to convert the alphabet into blocks, it is important to maintain the lookup table.

1.
Go to the plugins-folder, and open "Lookup Table.txt".

2.
Each entry is a pair of strings, separated by a comma is of the following format:
-First is the tape symbol
-Second is the Minecraft identifier for the block, of format "minecraft:<identifier>" without quotation marks.

Only use valid identifiers, otherwise the Minecraft client doesn't recognize the block. If you don't know the identifier, either find it out using the autofill feature of the Minecraft console, or consult the Minecraft wiki: https://minecraft.wiki/w/Block. 

It is important each used tape symbol is presented in the table, otherwise the Minecraft plugin isn't able to generate a valid Turing machine.

Once finished, save the file and close it.


[][] Minecraft plugin [][]

1.
Launch Minecraft in the same version as the server, and the server by running "run.bat".

2.
Once both are finished, in the Minecraft client, go to Multiplayer -> Direct Connection, and enter the IPv4 address of the host.

If you don't know the IPv4 address, here's how to find it: In the host machine or other computers connected to the same network, type in Windows' Command Prompt "ipconfig" without quotation marks, and look for the IPv4 address.

3.
Typing "/generateturing <name of the set of instructions>" without quotation marks will generate the Turing Machine in Minecraft.
Typing "/clearturing <name of the set of instructions>" without quotation marks will clear the Turing Machine.

Pressing the "Start" button will start the Turing Machine execution.
Pressing the "Pause" button will pause the execution.
Pressing the "Reset" button will reset the tape's values into the air blocks (equivalent of empty tape cell) and set the state into the initial state.

4.
Once you've finished using the program, disconnect in the Minecraft client and type "stop" into the server console.
